We all use Google service or atleast most of us do. Google Task is a popular simple application for managing your to-do list. In case you are using Jira as well where tickets and issues are assigned to you then I can undestand it can be overwhelming looking at your tasks and activities at different places.

In this video I will share how you can very easily create tasks in Google from Jira, but not just all task. We will learn how we can create only the tasks relevant to you using a JQL.
